<p> The hockey hour is upon the villagers and a local tournament is about to begin. The prize is a fattened goat or khasi- after which the tournament is named and it is through hundreds of events like this that Sundergarh‟s most unusual heritage stays alive. An hour before the match, the field is overrun by dozens of little boys-all wanting to be Dilips between five and eight years, their faces shining and their sweaty little bodies a blur as they run barefoot on the rocky ground. Some have barely entered the village school but they know their hockey. In this tribal belt a child‟s first toy is a hockey stick. Not just the number of bullocks he owns judges an eligible groom, but also by the goals he scores. Weddings are solemnized with an over field face-off between families.</p>
